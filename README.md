# E-commerce-Shopper-Behavior-Prediction
I developed machine learning models to predict online shoppers' purchase intentions on a webpage. By utilizing various data analysis techniques, binomial logistic regression and support vector machines with SMOTE analysis, I addressed dataset imbalance and achieved accurate predictions. I also gained valuable experience and emphasized the importance of cross-validation.

## Aim
To predict whether or not a customer is likely to complete a purchase. 

## Prerequisites
This project requires Python 3.x and a Python IDE such as Jupyter Notebook or PyCharm. You will also need to install the following packages: 

- pandas 
- numpy 
- matplotlib 
- seaborn 
- scikit-learn


## Usage
To use this project, clone the repository and open the project in your Python IDE of choice. The project is divided into 4 main sections: Data Exploration, Feature Engineering, Model Building, and Evaluation. The code for each section can be found in the corresponding jupyter notebook files. You can understand the code by seeing the python comments above each line of the code.

Once you have completed the code in each section, you can run the file to generate the final output. This will generate a confusion matrix and accuracy score for the model with different plots. 

## Conclusion
This project provides an example of how data analysis and machine learning can be used to predict customer intentions in an online shopping context. By following the steps provided, you can use the same techniques to analyze other datasets with the same structure.
